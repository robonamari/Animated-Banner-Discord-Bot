## Contributing to Animated-Banner-Discord-Bot

We’re excited to have you contribute to Animated-Banner-Discord-Bot! To ensure a smooth and effective collaboration, we ask that you take a moment to review the following guidelines. These are intended to make the process as easy as possible for everyone involved.

Please note that these are guidelines, not strict rules — we encourage contributions of all kinds, and we’re here to help you along the way.

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

If you run into a bug, here are a few tips to make your report as helpful as possible:

1. **Check before posting.** Try searching existing issues to avoid duplicates — if the issue already exists, feel free to add more info instead of opening a new one.
2. **Share full error details.** If there’s a traceback or exception, please include the _entire_ output. Missing pieces make it harder (or impossible) for us to debug.
3. **Be clear and complete.** The more context you give (steps to reproduce, expected behavior, etc.), the quicker we can act on it. If your report is unclear or incomplete, we may have to follow up — and if there’s no reply for a while, the issue might be closed.

## 🚀 Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests are always welcome! Here’s how to make sure yours fits in smoothly:

- Keep your changes focused — one topic per PR is ideal.
- Try to follow the style of the existing code.
- If your change adds functionality, adding or updating docstrings and tests is a big plus.

Clean, focused PRs are easier to review — and more likely to get merged quickly.

### 📝 Commit Message Tips

Writing good commits helps us understand what changed and why. Here’s our preferred style:

- Use **present tense**, like `Fix bug` or `Add feature`, not past tense (`Fixed`, `Added`)
- Try to keep lines under **72 characters**
- If referencing issues or pull requests, do it outside the subject line — and use shorthand like `#1` instead of full URLs

> Don’t worry if it’s not perfect! We can help clean things up during review. But giving it your best makes everyone’s life easier
